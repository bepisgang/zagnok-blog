# Hi There!

Here's an inaugural post for a blog to chronicle development of Zagnok. It's mostly to help me remember and document stuff, but you're welcome to follow along if you like!

The idea for Zagnok began as a hackathon project I worked on with my sister. We were big into Slackbots and big into being nerds, so we decided to try writing a bot that acted as a sort of DM for Slack-based D&D/Pathfinder encounters.

Which is pretty much the most productive way possible to use Slack, and I'm sure exactly what was envisioned for the product.
