Right now I'm working on parsing data from the Pathfinder 1E bestiary. I've mostly been using regular expressions to parse the various lines and sections and that's worked fairly well - until now.
<!-- more -->
Meet Spell-Like Abilities. This section contains several lines, each of which contains a frequency followed by a comma-separated list of ability names. They look something like this:

**Spell-Like Abilities** (CL 7th)<br>
At willâ€”*darkness*, *dispel magic*

Easy, right? We don't even need a regex for this: Just explode/split the list on the commas and done! But wait. Each ability can also have extra info, such as a difficulty class, which follows the ability name in parentheses:

**Spell-Like Abilities** (CL 7th)<br>
3/dayâ€”*darkness*, *hallucinatory terrain* (DC 18), *knock*, *light*

OK, now we're getting into regex territory. We can still split on the comma, then regex-parse each result into ability name and optional DC. Hold on, though! There can be more details in those parentheses:

**Spell-Like Abilities** (CL 7th)<br>
At willâ€”*greater teleport* (self plus 50 lbs. of objects only), *minor image* (DC 17), *unholy blight* (DC 19)
 
 Wellâ€¦ this is starting to look more like free text, isn't it? Take a look at the spell-like abilities for the [Devil, Erinyes](http://legacy.aonprd.com/bestiary/devil.html#devil-erinyes) entry: 
 
**Spell-Like Abilities** (CL 12th)<br>
At willâ€”*fear* (single target, DC 19), *greater teleport* (self plus 50 lbs. of objects only), *minor image* (DC 17), *unholy blight* (DC 19)

Commas and commas and commasâ€¦ Perhaps a pure regular expression approach is not the best solution to this problem. At least, not at my own skill level. Is it possible we need to write an actual grammar for spells and spell-like abilities, and parse each line according to that? ðŸ¤”

The first question to ask is "Do we need a high level of granularity in this data?" Is it enough simply to store the text somewhere in a human-readable form? I say nay! That _would_ work for a large range of use cases, but since we want this data to be as actionable as possible I think it behooves us to break it down as much as we can. For now I think keeping the more arbitrary text like "self plus 50 lbs. of objects only" as just text is fine - but I suspect we could actually find a pattern to that and break it down as well.
